# mqtt-iot-system
A proof-of-concept IoT system designed to demonstrate IoT workflows using MQTT publish-subscribe paradigm.


## Why This Project?
This project provided me with the opportunity to:
1. Learn how IoT devices communicate with a backend via MQTT.
2. Integrate with Flask and Flask-MQTT to handle IoT data.
3. Validate workflows using Pytest for test automation.


## Tools and Libraries:
Flask, Flask-MQTT, Pytest.
